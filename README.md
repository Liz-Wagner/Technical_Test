1. Fork and clone the repo

2. Run 'cp .env.sample'

3. Update .env file with "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/releases" into "url"

4. Run npm install
    (this will install axios, dotenv, and jest)

5. Run "npm start" in terminal to create the csv file

I realize this may be over kill given the directions, but I wanted to show more of my experience in dealing with api calls.
